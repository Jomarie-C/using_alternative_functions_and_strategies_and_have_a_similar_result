# Pseudocode
    # Ask the user to enter their full name
    # Initialize a variable with an empty string
    # Create a loop that continuously checks and converts each character in the given input
        # If a character in the given input is in lower case
            # Convert it to upper case
            # Print the output with an uppercase format
        # If a character in the given input is already in upper case
            # Print the output with an uppercase format
