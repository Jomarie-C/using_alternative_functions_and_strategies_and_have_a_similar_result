# Pseudocode
    # Ask the user for an input
    # Initialize an empty string
    # Check the given input and find the non-space character by initializing a boolean variable
    # Create a loop to check each character until it finds a non-space character
        # If the conditions were met
            # Print the correct output
        # If the given input doesn't have leading spaces
            # Display the correct output
